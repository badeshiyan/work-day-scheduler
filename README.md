# work-day-scheduler

## Overview:

This project includes the use of dynamically updated HTML, CSS and jQuery to generate a simple calendar application. In said calendar, the user is able to input and save 'to-do's' throughout a 9am - 5pm workday allotment. In addition to the previously mentioned coding concepts, the calendar also utilizes the moment.js library to accurately display the current date and time.
